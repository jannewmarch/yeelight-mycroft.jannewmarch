 Yeelight smart light
Skill to manage the Yeelight smart lights

## About 
Yeelight make a white light and a colour bulb. This can be controlled through two ways: remotely via the Yeelight server and locally using the LAN. This project controls Yeelights using the local LAN. Note that the Yeelights have to be configured to use the local LAN - the default is off.

## Examples 
* "Bedroom light on"
* "Lounge light off"
* "Light on"
* "Light off"

If no location is given, and there are one or more lights, then 
the first one detected will be used.
