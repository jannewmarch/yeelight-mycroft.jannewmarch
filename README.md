 Yeelight smart light
Skill to manage the Yeelight smart lights

## About 
Yeelight make a white light and a colour bulb. This can be controlled through two ways: remotely via the Yeelight server and locally using the LAN. This project controls Yeelights using the local LAN. Note that the Yeelights have to be configured to use the local LAN - the default is off.

## Examples 
* "Turn bedroom light on"
* "Turn lounge light off"

## Credits

## Usage
If there is no light at the location given, the intent will fail, otherwise it will succeed.

Warning: Discovery of lights is unreliable. Reported as a bug to Yeelight, no response received. So
sometimes this skill will fail due to bugs in Yeelight networking.
